# ToyCalc - A Complex Number Command-Line and Interactive Calculator

ToyCalc is a versatile calculator written in Go that operates on complex numbers. It provides a command-line interface for quick calculations and an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for a more engaging experience. All calculations are performed using `complex128` for robust handling of complex arithmetic.

## Current Features (End of Stage 1)

* **Core Arithmetic:** Supports `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division).
* **Power Operator:** `^` for exponentiation (e.g., `2^3`, `(-4)^0.5`, `(1+i)^2`). Uses principal values.
* **Modulo Operator (`%`):** Implemented for complex numbers using the Gaussian integer remainder definition (remainder `r = a - xb`, where `x` is the complex integer closest to `a/b`). This ensures $|r/b| \le 1/\sqrt{2}$.
* **Unary Operators:**
    * Unary minus (e.g., `-5`, `-(1+2i)`). Correctly handles sign for principal value calculations (e.g., `(-4)^0.5` results in `2i`).
    * Unary plus (e.g., `+5`) is recognized but has no operational effect.
* **Grouping Symbols:** Supports `()`, `[]`, and `{}` interchangeably for grouping expressions.
* **Basic Functions:**
    * `log(x)`: Natural logarithm (principal value, works for complex `x`).
    * `exp(x)`: Exponential function $e^x$ (works for complex `x`).
* **Imaginary Unit `i`:** The constant `i` is recognized as `complex(0, 1)`.
* **Complex Number Backend:** All calculations internally use Go's `complex128` type.
* **Output Formatting:**
    * Results are displayed as real numbers if the imaginary part is negligible (close to zero within a defined epsilon).
    * Otherwise, full complex numbers are displayed (e.g., `3+2i`, `-1-0.5i`).
    * Handles `NaN` and `Infinity` display.
* **Two Modes of Operation:**
    1.  **Command-Line (CLI):** Evaluate expressions directly.
    2.  **Interactive (REPL):** Start `toycalc` without arguments to enter an interactive session.
* **Integrated Help System:** Basic help available via `toycalc help` or `help [topic]` in REPL.

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

To evaluate an expression directly:

```bash
toycalc <expression>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
toycalc 10 + 2 * 3
toycalc "(1+2*i) / (3-i) - ( -4 ) ^ 0.5"
toycalc 10 % 3.2
toycalc log(-1)
toycalc exp(i*pi) # (Note: 'pi' constant will be in Stage 3, use its value for now)
```

* It's **highly recommended to quote expressions** containing spaces or shell special characters (like `*`, `(`, `)`, `^`, `!`) to ensure the shell passes the expression to `toycalc` correctly.
    Example: `toycalc "2 * (3 + 4)!"`

### Interactive Mode (REPL)

To start the interactive mode, simply run `toycalc` without any arguments:

```bash
./toycalc
```

You will see a prompt:

```
ToyCalc Interactive Mode (v0.1 Stage 1)
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to leave, or 'help' for assistance.
>>>
```

Then, type your expressions and press Enter:

```
>>> 10 % -3
1
>>> (1+i)^2
0+2i
>>> log(-1)
0+3.141592653589793i
>>> help log
(Help text for log will be displayed)
>>> exit
Exiting ToyCalc.
```

* Type `exit` or `quit` to leave the interactive mode.
* Type `help` or `help [topic]` for assistance.

## Building from Source

1.  Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.16+ recommended).
2.  Clone the repository (or ensure all source files: `main.go`, `core.go`, `lexer.go`, `parser.go`, `evaluator.go`, `help.go`, `toycalc_test.go` are in the same directory).
3.  Navigate to the project's root directory.
4.  Run:
    ```bash
    go build
    ```
5.  This will create the `toycalc` executable in the current directory.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
go test -v
```

## Planned Future Stages (Roadmap)

* **Stage 2: Standard Mathematical Functions:**
    * Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2).
    * Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh).
    * Additional logarithmic functions (log10, log2).
    * Explicit `sqrt(x)` function.
* **Stage 3: Advanced Operators & Combinatorial Functions:**
    * Factorial operator `x!` (using Gamma function: $\Gamma(x+1)$).
    * Combinatorial functions: `nCr(n,k)` and `nPr(n,k)` (using Gamma functions).
    * Predefined constants: `pi`, `e`.
* **Stage 4: Usability & Parser Enhancements:**
    * Implied multiplication (e.g., `2(3+4)`).
    * Improved error reporting with more precise positions.
    * More detailed and categorized help system.
* **Stage 5: Advanced Numeric Features:**
    * Full complex number input parsing (e.g., "3+2.5i").
    * User-defined variables.
    * (Potentially) User-defined functions.
    * (Potentially) Support for arbitrary-precision numbers (`big.Float`, `big.Complex`).
