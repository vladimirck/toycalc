# ToyCalc - A Complex Number Command-Line and Interactive Calculator

ToyCalc is a versatile calculator written in Go that operates on complex numbers. It provides a command-line interface for quick calculations and an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for a more engaging experience. All calculations are performed using `complex128` for robust handling of complex arithmetic.

## Current Features

* **Core Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
* **Power Operator:** `^` (principal value).
* **Modulo Operator (`%`):** Gaussian integer remainder definition.
* **Unary Operators:** `+` (no-op), `-` (negation, handles sign for principal values, e.g., `(-4)^0.5` is `2i`).
* **Implied Multiplication:** Supports common cases like `2(3+4)`, `(1+2)(3+4)`, `3i`, `2log(x)`, `sin(pi)cos(pi)`.
* **Grouping Symbols:** `()`, `[]`, `{}` (interchangeable).
* **Constants:**
    * `i` (imaginary unit).
    * `pi` (mathematical constant $\pi$).
    * `e` (Euler's number).
* **Complex Number Backend:** All calculations use Go's `complex128`.
* **Output Formatting:**
    * Real numbers shown if imaginary part is negligible.
    * Pure imaginary numbers shown as `Ni` (e.g., `2i`, `-3.5i`).
    * Whole numbers formatted without unnecessary decimals.
    * Handles `NaN` and `Infinity`.
* **Two Modes of Operation:**
    1.  **Command-Line (CLI):** Evaluate expressions directly.
    2.  **Interactive (REPL):** With line editing and persistent command history (`~/.toycalc_history`).
* **Core Complex Functions:**
    * `real(x)`, `imag(x)`: Extract real/imaginary parts.
    * `abs(x)`: Magnitude (modulus).
    * `phase(x)`: Argument/angle in radians $(-\pi, \pi]$.
    * `conj(x)`: Complex conjugate.
* **Exponential & Logarithmic Functions (Principal Values):**
    * `exp(x)`: $e^x$.
    * `log(x)`: Natural logarithm.
    * `log10(x)`: Base-10 logarithm.
    * `log2(x)`: Base-2 logarithm.
    * `sqrt(x)`: Principal square root.
* **Trigonometric Functions (Radians, Principal Values for Inverses):**
    * `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`
    * `asin(x)`, `acos(x)`, `atan(x)`
* **Hyperbolic Functions (Principal Values for Inverses):**
    * `sinh(x)`, `cosh(x)`, `tanh(x)`
    * `asinh(x)`, `acosh(x)`, `atanh(x)`
* **Angle Conversion Functions (Operate on full complex number):**
    * `degToRad(x)`: Scales complex number by $\pi/180$.
    * `radToDeg(x)`: Scales complex number by $180/\pi$.
* **Component-wise Integer Functions:**
    * `floor(x)`, `ceil(x)`, `round(x)`, `trunc(x)`
* **Integrated Help System:** `help [topic]` available in CLI and REPL.

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

To evaluate an expression directly:

```bash
toycalc <expression>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
toycalc 10 + 2 * 3
toycalc "(1+2i) / (3-i) - (-4)^0.5" # Explicit multiplication for i
toycalc 2(3+1) # Implied multiplication
toycalc 10 % 3.2
toycalc log(-1)
toycalc exp(i*pi)
toycalc sin(pi/2)cos(pi/2) # Implied multiplication between functions
```

* It's **highly recommended to quote expressions** containing spaces or shell special characters (like `*`, `(`, `)`, `^`) to ensure the shell passes the expression to `toycalc` correctly.
    Example: `toycalc "2 * ( (1+i)^2 + log(e) )"`

### Interactive Mode (REPL)

To start the interactive mode, simply run `toycalc` without any arguments:

```bash
./toycalc
```

You will see a prompt:

```
ToyCalc Interactive Mode (v0.2 Stage 2 with Readline & Implied Multiplication)
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to leave, or 'help' for assistance.
Use arrow keys for history and line editing.
>>>
```

Then, type your expressions and press Enter:

```
>>> 10 % -3
1
>>> (1+i)^2
2i
>>> 2(1+i)
2+2i
>>> sin(pi/2)cos(0)
1
>>> help sin
(Help text for sin will be displayed)
>>> exit
Exiting ToyCalc.
```

* Type `exit` or `quit` to leave the interactive mode.
* Type `help` or `help [topic]` for assistance.
* Command history is saved in `~/.toycalc_history`.

## Building from Source

1.  Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.16+ recommended).
2.  Clone the repository (or ensure all source files: `main.go`, `core.go`, `lexer.go`, `parser.go`, `evaluator.go`, `help.go`, `toycalc_test.go` are in the same directory).
3.  Navigate to the project's root directory.
4.  Run:
    ```bash
    go build
    ```
5.  This will create the `toycalc` executable in the current directory.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
go test -v
```

## Planned Future Stages (Roadmap)

* **Stage 3: Advanced Operators & Combinatorial Functions:**
    * (Deferred) Factorial operator `x!` and `gamma(x)` for general complex numbers (pending robust complex Gamma solution).
    * Combinatorial functions: `nCr(n,k)` and `nPr(n,k)` (implementation strategy pending Gamma decision; may be restricted to integers initially or deferred).
    * Additional less common mathematical constants (e.g., `phi`).
* **Stage 4: Usability & Parser Enhancements:**
    * Improved error reporting (more context, better positioning).
    * More detailed and categorized help system, potentially with search.
    * Advanced REPL features (e.g., tab completion for functions/constants).
* **Stage 5: Advanced Numeric & Expression Features:**
    * Full complex number input parsing (e.g., "3+2.5i", "1.2e-3 - 4.5j").
    * User-defined variables.
    * (Potentially) User-defined functions.
    * (Potential Revisit) Arbitrary-precision numbers (`big.Float`, `BigComplex`).
* **Stage 6: Comprehensive Multi-Value Exploration Engine:**
    * Mechanisms to explore non-principal values for multi-valued complex functions (e.g., `allRoots(base, n)`, `logBranch(z, k)`).
    * Set-based evaluation for combinatorial results.
    * User controls for exploration depth/criteria.
